# Welcome to the Site

Hello all, 👋🏽

My name is Dario and I've been working in the IT Support space for 5 years total. 4 years working for Amazon and 1 year working for The Chefs Warehouse.

Over the course of my experience I have had some amazing hands on time with some great technologies. Checkout the projects section for more info on projects that I have worked on.

# Inception of the Site
This site came about because I needed a place on the internet to share my work and my musings about technology, AI, and software development.
