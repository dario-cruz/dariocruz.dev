Hey all,

Apologies for the radio silence! Work has ramped up, and I've been focused on my studies, as you can see. ðŸ˜† Last Friday, on Oct 25, I sat down and took the Security+ SY0-701 certification examâ€”and passed! ðŸŽ‰

## The Exam Experience
Out of all the exams I have taken so far, I feel that the difficulty level of this exam was moderate. It would be harder if you took the exam without any prior IT experience. My exam comprised 3 performance-based questions, in which I had to use my knowledge to complete a set of tasks, and 72 multiple-choice questionsâ€”75 questions in total. As long as you have a study guide or a video course that covers all the exam domains, you should be fine. I took the time to dig deeper into specific topics, most notably **Cryptography** and **Public Key Infrastructure**, as those topics alone contain a wide range of technologies and concepts.

Additionally, it's pretty important to have a good set of practice exams. For this exam, I didnâ€™t use Anki flashcards. My thinking was that, since I had already learned most of the content through the Google Cybersecurity Professional course, I wouldnâ€™t need additional reinforcement as the concepts were already set in my memory. This approach worked well; any reinforcement of knowledge came from the practice exams, which gave me the needed feel of taking the actual test. My mind was ready! ðŸ¤“
