**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a framework of policies and technologies that ensure the management and security of accounts, allowing organizations to implement the concept of least privilege when it comes to the amount of access a user has and what resources that access can be applied to.

IAM is also a core component of the *CISSP certification*. Let's dive into the pillars of Identity and Access Management and how they can be applied to make your organization more secure. We will use the scope of #Entra ID, as #Microsoft has implemented all the necessary controls to carry out Identity and Access Management.

## The Pillars of IAM

Here are the core concepts that make up IAM:

### Identity Management

Identity Management involves the creation, maintenance, and deletion of accounts. Each user is assigned a unique identity that is placed into a repository. Users can manage their own profiles and reset passwords.

**Example:** Consider an organization that onboards new employees into its Active Directory/Entra ID system. The user receives account information to access their laptop, email, and other enterprise apps. AD/Entra ID administrators can update the account and make changes if the user changes roles or needs new permissions. The user can update their password and some profile information, like their profile photo. Once the user leaves, the account is marked for deletion based on the organization's account handling policies. On the day of off-boarding, the user will no longer have access to their account or any company resources.

### Authentication

Authentication verifies the identity of users, devices, or systems, ensuring that the party requesting access is who they claim to be.

**Example:** The Contoso Organization has configured its Active Directory/Entra ID systems with MFA, SSO, and Biometrics. When a user attempts to authenticate, they need a second factor of authentication. Users onboard with a fingerprint reader to generate biometric data. This data, along with the username and password, verifies the user's identity. SSO allows the user to stay logged in and not be prompted to authenticate when accessing enterprise applications. Admins can adjust the interval or factors required for re-authentication.

### Authorization

Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. This is achieved by setting up and enforcing policies. Entra ID uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and Policy-Based Access Control mechanisms for comprehensive user authorization.

**Example:** Contoso sets up RBAC so that only Operations department users have access to their cloud-based inventory management system. Warehouse users do not see this web app on their Entra ID My Apps page.

Contoso uses Entra ID Conditional Access to control login times, enforcing work hours and enhancing information security. These policies, based on attributes such as time and location, implement Attribute-Based Access Control.

Contoso also implements a Conditional Access policy that restricts access to the sales ERP system, which contains SPII, to on-premise users only.

### Access Management

Access Management enforces the policies and controls implemented, ensuring users have proper access to appropriate resources. Users should also be able to request specific access when needed.

**Example:** Contoso has enabled Privileged Identity Management (PIM) on their Entra ID tenant. PIM allows admins to configure eligible roles for specific groups or roles and control the duration and scope of these roles. Users with eligible roles can request access, pending admin approval.

### Governance and Compliance

Governance and Compliance involve adhering to regulatory requirements, internal policies, and industry standards. Auditing, reporting, policy management, and risk management fall under this pillar.

**Example:** Contoso configured Active Directory/Entra ID to make logs available for further investigation in Entra ID. Admins can view these logs in Microsoft Sentinel or ingest them into a SIEM or SOAR platform. These platforms report on user, group, and application activity, providing threat scoring and enabling security analysts to manage risk. Entra ID also includes Identity Protection and Risk-Based Conditional Access policies for managing user and sign-in risk.

### Monitoring and Intelligence

Monitoring and Intelligence involve continuously analyzing user activities to detect and respond to anomalies and security threats.

**Example:**:As mentioned earlier, Contoso logs are ingested into a SIEM or SOAR platform, where security analysts monitor user, group, and app activities. Microsoft Entra ID Identity Protection assists in detecting, investigating, and remediating risks. Admins can investigate user behavior, mark identities as compromised, and start remediation processes, such as password resets and MFA registration.

### Lifecycle Management

Lifecycle Management covers the entire identity lifecycle, from initial provisioning to de-provisioning and account cleanup. It also includes handling lifecycle events, such as promotions or department transfers, requiring changes in access levels, and ensuring account status matches the user's current status in the organization.

**Example:** Contoso hires George as a Quality Assurance manager. HR requests a Windows account with appropriate permissions from IT. Entra ID admins create the account with a role matching George's title. Upon George's promotion, admins update his role, granting access to more enterprise apps, including those with SPII. When George decides to leave after two years, HR informs IT of his departure date. Admins set Entra ID to disable the account on George's last workday. His identity is placed in the "Deleted Users" section, allowing 30 days for possible restoration.

## Key Takeaways

In summary, Identity and Access Management (IAM) is crucial for securing organizational resources and implementing least privilege access. By leveraging Entra ID, organizations can effectively manage identity lifecycle, authenticate users, enforce access policies, and ensure compliance. Understanding the pillars of IAM—Identity Management, Authentication, Authorization, Access Management, Governance and Compliance, Monitoring and Intelligence, and Lifecycle Management—enables businesses to build a robust security framework. Implementing these practices helps protect sensitive information, streamline user access, and enhance overall security posture.
