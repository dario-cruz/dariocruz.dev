# About me üëãüèæ

My name is Dario and I have been working in tech for the last 5 years. In that time i have learned a great deal about what it takes to be in this industry, consistent learning, applying that learning, and I good set of soft skills will take you a very long way.

I was actually invited into this industry by two of my colleges after and insightful conversation around networking and building out home labs. Since then I have worked on numerous projects in my time at amazon. Everything from Juniper Firewalls and Cisco Switches to Kevia Robots and AR Robotics stations, running Amazons on custom in house distribution of Linux. In 2019 I decided to go ahead and confirm my knowledge of networking by obtaining the CompTIA Network+ certification.

Since then I have moved on form Amazon Opstech IT life and am currently employed at a high quality food distributor known as The Chefs Warehouse where I support a Hybrid Active Directory environment, ERP Systems (Canopy, JDE, AS400), and assist in change management tasks for the Chefs Warehouse network. 

While I love doing being in the role of IT Support, I feel it is now time to set my sights on a new challenge. I have done a bit of soul searching and experimentation, looking into different IT fields, learning some Front-End development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React), studying for different certifications etc but, I have landed on a field that is of the most interest to me and that is Cybersecurity.
