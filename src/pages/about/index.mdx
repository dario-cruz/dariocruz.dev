# About Me  

My name is **Dario Cruz**, and I am an IT professional with **7 years of experience** in the technology industry. Throughout this journey, Iâ€™ve learned that success in tech requires continuous learning, practical application of new skills, and a strong set of soft skills to complement technical expertise.  

## Professional Experience  

I got my start in IT thanks to two colleagues who encouraged me after an insightful conversation about networking and building home labs. Soon afterward, I joined **Amazonâ€™s OpsTech IT team**, where I served as an IT Equipment Coordinator and later as an IT Support Associate II.  

During my tenure at Amazon, I worked on a wide range of projects â€“ from configuring **Juniper firewalls and Cisco switches** to supporting cutting-edge warehouse technology like **Kiva robots** and **AR robotic stations** running Amazonâ€™s custom Linux distribution. In 2019, I also earned my **CompTIA Network+ certification** to deepen my networking expertise. My years at Amazon taught me the importance of robust infrastructure and adaptability â€“ skills I carried forward into my next role.  

In 2023, I transitioned to **The Chefsâ€™ Warehouse** â€“ a leading specialty food distributor â€“ and was soon promoted from an IT Support role to **Junior Systems Administrator**. In my current position, I manage a **hybrid Active Directory environment** and oversee critical ERP systems (Canopy, JDE, AS/400), while also assisting in **network change management** to support a robust IT infrastructure. This role has allowed me to broaden my expertise in system administration and take on greater responsibility in ensuring smooth IT operations across the organization.  

## Ongoing Learning and Cybersecurity Focus  

While I have greatly enjoyed my work in IT support and systems administration, Iâ€™m always seeking new challenges and growth opportunities. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve explored various IT domains â€“ including **front-end web development** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React) and additional certifications â€“ as part of my continual learning process.  

These explorations helped me discover that **cybersecurity** is the field Iâ€™m most passionate about, and I am now actively channeling my efforts toward growing in that area. Iâ€™ve been building my skills through **hands-on projects**, **labs**, and **self-study in cybersecurity**, with the goal of transitioning into a security-focused role in the future. This continuous learning mindset ensures I stay adaptable and ready to tackle the latest challenges in the tech world.  

## Get in Touch  

I am always open to new opportunities where I can apply my expertise in **IT support, networking, systems administration, and cybersecurity**.
